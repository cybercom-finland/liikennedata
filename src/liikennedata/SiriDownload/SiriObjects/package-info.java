/**
 * Contains automatically-built objects for storing data downloaded from Siri. The class generation is performed manually, but there should be no need to change these classes after generation.
 * The classes are produced from json by using this: http://jsongen.byingtondesign.com/index.jsp
 * The root class is the only class in this package which does not get generated from the Siri json and it is called SiriRoot.
